        I am a self-taught software developer living in south-western Ontario.
        I know a variety of programming languages and do both full stack and embedded development.
        I&apos;ve worked as a full stack developer for two years for <a className="link-text" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://encircleapp.com">Encircle</a>, and can provide references from them.
        I also do electrical engineering (messing around with Arduinos and robots) and machine learning projects as a hobby.
